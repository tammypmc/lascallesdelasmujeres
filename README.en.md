## Project description

This is a collaborative project of Geochicas to produce a map of the streets named after women in Latin America and Spain. This proposal seeks to link and generate content in OSM and Wikipedia about prominent women.

The main goal is to create a new storytelling in a collaborative manner, and thus emphasize the importance of remembering women, their struggles and achievements through public and digital space.

For this reason we have generated a map of the streets that have names of women in the different cities of Latin America and Spain, and thus to show the gap that historically exists within cities.

It is intended to make a survey of information on streets, avenues, passages, roads that have the names of women and also their respective biographies in Wikipedia. It will also be encouraged to add the names of streets corresponding to women that are not mapped in OpenStreetMap (free and collaborative map) and the creation of their articles in Wikipedia.

The project was officially presented within the framework of International Women's Day, on March 8.


### Current state

The project is still under development. The idea is to gradually expand the number of mapped cities, which so far are:

- Asunción, Paraguay
- Barcelona, España
- Buenos Aires, Argentina
- Cochabamba, Bolivia
- Lima, Perú
- Montevideo, Uruguay
- Ciudad de México
- La Habana, Cuba
- Rosario, Argentina

Work in progress:
- Santa Fe, Argentina
